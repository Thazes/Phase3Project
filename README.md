## Project Overview 

Reducing customer churn is crucial for sustaining revenue and profitability. Identifying at-risk customers allows for proactive retention strategies, such as tailored offers and service improvements. A data-driven approach enhances customer satisfaction, strengthens loyalty, and supports long-term business growth.


### Business Understanding

In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention is crucial for sustained business growth. A significant challenge faced by telecom providers is customer churn, where users discontinue their services. Understanding the factors influencing churn can help companies take proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce revenue loss.

This dataset contains various attributes related to customer usage patterns, service plans, and interactions with customer support. By analyzing this data, we aim to build a predictive model that can identify customers at high risk of churning.

#### Business Objectives
 1. Predict churn probability: Develop a model to classify customers as likely to churn or likely to stay based on their usage behavior.

 2. Identify key churn indicators: Determine which factors (e.g., high call charges, frequent customer service calls, etc.) contribute the most to churn.



### Data Understanding

The data set had 3,333 rows and 21 columns with different data types

### Data Cleaning

Upon further analysis the dataset didn't have any null or duplicated values therefore minimal cleaning of data was needed.

Next I looked at the Outliers. The Box plot below shows how they were distributed:

![alt text](https://github.com/Thazes/Phase3Project/blob/main/photos/box%20plot%20showing%20outliers.png)

I dropped all rows with outliers

### EDA and data analysis
I plotted a histogram showing how the numerical values are distributed

![alt text](https://github.com/Thazes/Phase3Project/blob/main/photos/Histogram%20Numerical%20Columns.png)

From the above Histograms The following columns seem to be having a unifirm distribution:

accountlength,total day minutes,total day calls,total day charge,total eve minutes,total eve calls,total eve charge,total night minutes,total night calls,total night charge,total intl minutes,total intl charge

Next I plotted a correlation matrix of numeric the variables 
![alt text](https://github.com/Thazes/Phase3Project/blob/main/photos/correlationmatricnumeric.png)

Total day minutes and total day charge have a perfect correlation (1.00), indicating a direct linear relationship (likely because total day charge is derived from total day minutes). Similarly, total eve minutes and total eve charge, total night minutes and total night charge, total intl minutes and total intl charge also show a perfect correlation (1.00).

Since total day charge is derived from total day minutes,total eve minutes and total eve charge and finally total night minutes and total night charge one of them from the pairs should be dropped to avoid multicollinearity in modeling.

I will display relationship between churn and international plan using the histogram below
![alt text](https://github.com/Thazes/Phase3Project/blob/main/photos/histogramchurnvsinternationalplan.png)

From the above histogram, we can see that churn was mostly experienced on customers on the international plan. This makes sense as it could probably mean that they were visiting the country hence once done they did not see the need top use their phone numbers.

Total Day Minutes and Churn
The first column (and row) represents Total Day Minutes. Churned customers (orange) seem to spend more minutes on calls during the day compared to non-churned customers. This could indicate that heavy daytime call usage is correlated with customer churn.

Total Evening and Night Minutes
For Total Evening Minutes and Total Night Minutes, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a strong visible separation between churned and non-churned customers. This suggests that evening and night call durations may not be strong indicators of churn.

Total International Minutes and Churn
The Total Intl Minutes (bottom right corner) shows a slightly different density distribution for churned customers. If churned customers tend to have higher international call minutes, it might indicate dissatisfaction with international call rates or service.


### Pre-Processing
I Defined  X (features) and Y (target) then proceeded encode target variable as it was boolean

Unique columns for the categorical columns

Now I proceeded to Encode categorical columns

####  Splitting into training and test data

I proceeded to split the data into training and test data.

### Modelling and Processing of Data
I created the following models
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN
3. Random forest
4. Decision Tree

Form the above the models, I identified Random forest as the best model:
This is because:

* It has the Best balance between precision (0.95) and recall (0.50) for churned customers
* It has the Highest accuracy (93%)
* And finally it Performs better than Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression on f1-score

Now I will look into identifying which parameters affect churn the most by adjusting the parameters  

![alt text](https://github.com/Thazes/Phase3Project/blob/main/photos/factors.png)

From the above barplot we can see that total day minutes affected churn the most followed by international plan

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the tuned random forest was the best model to perform the predictions as it had highest precison of 0.95 and highest churn recall(0.5) ou of all models

Precision (0.95 for churned customers)
Out of all customers the model predicted as "churned," 95% were actually churned This means we have very few false positives (customers mistakenly identified as churned)

Recall (0.50 for churned customers)
Out of all actual churned customers, only 50% were correctly identified This means some churned customers were missed (false negatives)

Top 3 Features which majorly affect the churn are total day minutes, international plan and total eveing minutes.
